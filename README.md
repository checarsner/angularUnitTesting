## Prerequisites

* nodejs current version
* npm (installed with nodejs)
* karma-cli (npm install -g karma-cli)

### How it works

* Check out Step-1 with command 'git checkout tags/Step-1'
* Make the test(s) pass
* Check out the next step e.g. Step-2

### If you can't get the test to pass or need an answer

* Check out Tag-Answer
* eg git checkout tags/Step-2-Answer

### Note!

* There is no tag for Step-1-Answer as that the answer is making 1 + 1 = 2
* You must run npm install when you get to Step 5 for everything to work.
* Step 5 has no answer because its the same code from the previous step. Its a move to karma/jasmine/phantomjs
