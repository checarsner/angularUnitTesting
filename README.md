### How it works

* Check out Step-1 with command 'git checkout tags/Step-1'
* Make the test(s) pass
* Check out the next step e.g. Step-2

### If you can't get the test to pass or need an answer

* Check out Tag-Answer
* eg git checkout tags/Step-2-Answer

### Note!

* There is no tag for Step-1-Answer as that the answer is making 1 + 1 = 2
